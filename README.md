# Supercollider4Ableton

M4L or audo plugin allowing information to flow between the Supercollider and Ableton Live environments  

This goal of this piece of software is to allow

- Midi/Audio from Abelton to flow into specific Supercollider paths
- Midi/Audio from Supercollider to flow into specific Abelton paths
- Ableton Scene and Samples to be triggered from Supercollider
- Supercollider scripts to be automated and triggered from Abelton

## Get involved!

If you want to get involved, please do! We are looking for contributions of all kinds :-)

If you want to meet IRL come by an event of [Berlin Supercollider Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Supercollider-Hack-Learn-and-Play/)

## General Idea

Supercollider is a great way to create awesome soundscapes, but not the easiest way to make more conventional electronic music
By combining the logic flow of Ableton with the sonic possibilities of Supercollider, a sound artist would be a able to harness both worlds

Of course it is already possible to have both Ableton and Supercollider running simultaneously,
this project attempts to allow for:

- simple set up
- simple audio routing
- simple start / stop from either environment

## Tentative plan

- [ ] Find other contributors
- [ ] MVP
- [ ] Prototype with electronic artists and improve
- [ ] Profit?
